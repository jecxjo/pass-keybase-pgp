# pass-keybase-pgp
A pass extension to use keybase as your gpg client

Basic functionality, copied either from the original pass code or from
[mbauhardt/pass-keybase](https://github.com/mbauhardt/pass-keybase) and
modified to use `keybase pgp encrypt/decrypt`. Will add better documentation later but for the moment you can:

- `encrypt` to add a new password
- `decrypt` to view a password
- `edit` to mdoify a password
